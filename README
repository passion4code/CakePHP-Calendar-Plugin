Package Info
------------------------------------------

Author: Jason Rose
Framework: CakePHP 
Versions: 1.3.x (should be compatible with 1.2.x) 
Description: Very basic calendar helper contained within a plugin to assist with rendering an extensible HTML calendar. This has been built with localization in mind, using the strftime method to output content relative to the users set timezone.  Various classnames and HTML element control can be managed using attributes of the helper


Roadmap: 
- Support Documentation w/ Example Usage
- AJAX navigation support
- Options for trailing or leading days rather than showing empty table cells
- Easier adding of content to days through class method rather than options
